# Web Server Implementation in Java
This repository contains implementations of both single-threaded and multi-threaded web servers in Java. Each implementation has separate folders containing Server.java and Client.java files. The servers are tested using Apache JMeter for performance evaluation.

# Features
  Single-threaded server: Handles one client at a time.
  Multi-threaded server: Uses a thread pool to handle multiple clients concurrently.
  Timeout handling: Configurable timeout for client connections.
  Performance Testing: JMeter scripts for testing.
